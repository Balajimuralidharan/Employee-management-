The Employee Management System is a sophisticated desktop application crafted using Java and JFrame components within the NetBeans IDE. This application is designed to streamline the management of employee data, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for handling various HR functions. It offers essential features including adding new employees, searching for specific records, updating existing information, deleting records, and viewing all employees in a comprehensive format.
The system's core functionality revolves around seamless interaction with an Oracle database.

The database schema encompasses critical employee details such as Employee ID, first name, last name, email, phone number, hire date, job ID, salary, commission percentage, manager ID, department ID, department name, and gender.
Users benefit from an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies complex data management tasks. The application is designed to handle various user inputs and perform validations to maintain data integrity. Error handling mechanisms are in place to alert users of incomplete or incorrect data entries, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the system.
This Employee Management System represents a powerful tool for HR departments and administrative personnel, aiming to optimize the management of employee records through efficient data handling and secure storage solutions. Future updates may include additional features such as role-based access control, data export/import capabilities, and web-based access to broaden its usability and accessibility.
